# PWR_PVD_Polling

## Introduction

This demo shows the  PWR's PVD polling.
After running the program, observe the LED state to judge whether the current voltage is greater than or less than PVD threshold.

## Run

1. if the current voltage is greater than PVD threshold, LED2 level inversion 10 times than LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4 keep light.
2. if the current voltage is less than PVD threshold, LED2 level inversion 10 times first and than LED1 level inversion 10 timesï¼ŒLED1, LED2, LED3,  LED4 keep light at last.
