# FLASH_SIM_EEPROM

## Introduction

This demo shows the  FLASH's analog eeprom function.
Using FLASH to simulate EEPROM for data transmission, first write to the same address, then read. This program indicates whether the simulated EEPROM data transmission is successful or not by turning on or off the LED.

## Run

1. if LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 are all light and on continuously, the FLASH simulation EEPROM is successful, and the data of write operation is the same as that of read operation.
2. if LED1 and LED2 are off, the read-write data of FLASH analog EEPROM does not match.
