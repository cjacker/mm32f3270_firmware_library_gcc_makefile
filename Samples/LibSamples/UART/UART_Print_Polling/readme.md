## Introduction

This Demo verifies the UART's print feature by using plliong meathod. 
After the RXD of UART receives the data, it sends the same data through TXD .

## Run

Send '1234567890' to MCU by serial debuggin assistant XCOM, and XCOM receive '1234567890', and meanwhile, LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 shining.
