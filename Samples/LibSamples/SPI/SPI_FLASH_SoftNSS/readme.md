# SPI_FALSH_SoftNSS

## Introduction

This demo shows the SPI's communication, control chip select signal (NSS).

Read and write instructions are sent to W25D16 through SPI to operate, write and read data to the same address of W25D16.

## Run

1. Run the program and print the data through serial port as followsï¼š

   SPI2 test

   rx[0]=0x0

   rx[1]=0x2

   rx[2]=0x4

   rx[3]=0x6

   rx[4]=0x8

   rx[5]=0xa

   rx[6]=0xc

   rx[7]=0xe

   rx[8]=0x10

   rx[9]=0x12
