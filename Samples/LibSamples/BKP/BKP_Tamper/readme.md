# BKP_Tamper

## Introduction

This demo shows MCU's BKP feature.

Whether the function is normal is indicated by the on and off of LED1.

## Run

Observe the on and off of LED1 to judge whether the function is normal:
If LED1 is on, it means that the BKP data is read and written normally;
If LED1 is off, it means that the BKP data is read and written abnormal.
